    For me, an ideal WeChat news feed is a combination of simple, sharable pieces and occasional quality longforms.

Apart from just stating the story, Mr. Jiazhuang does not fear embedding his own opinions as well. Popular stories on WeChat do not always need to follow current trendy topics, Mr. Jiazhuang manages to keep the audience intrigued by offering the content that is simply crafted with care.

    <h4><b>In A Relationship With A Highly Sensitive Person? Here's What You Need To Know</b></h4>
    <br>
    <h5><b>By Lindsay Holmes</b></h5>
    <br>
    <p>Let's be honest: relationships are complex, no matter what kind of personality you have. And some truths are universal, like fighting is never fun. Romantic gestures are usually appreciated. Communication is definitely valued. Compromise isn't always easy.</p>
    <p>But a lot of these nuances are only heightened if you're of a more sensitive nature. Below are nine things to keep in mind if you're in a relationship with a highly sensitive person.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>We're intuitive.</b><br>It's no secret that HSPs <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/30/understanding-highly-sensitive-people_n_7164286.html" target="_blank">pick up on subtleties</a> in a room or conversation, but it's a point worth driving home. If our significant other is upset, chances are we're going to notice. Sensitive individuals are very intuitive when it comes to mood shifts, whether it's a quippy remark or even just a different texting tone. There's a <i>big</i> difference between "Can I see you tonight?" and "Am I seeing you tonight?" or "I'm fine!" and "I'm fine."</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>We love deeply.</b><br>Because we are so driven by our emotions, that usually means we don't take any relationship -- or our feelings about it -- lightly, according to Elaine Aron, author of <i>The Highly Sensitive Person</i> and one of the original scientific researchers of HSPs. "We don't think about anything if we're not motivated by some emotion, whether it's curiosity, love, anger or fear," she told The Huffington Post. "We think about things because we feel something about them."</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>We struggle with conflict.</b><br>Fighting with a significant other is terrible for anyone, but for an HSP, conflict is particularly uncomfortable. That's because we're having an internal debate of our own during the process. "<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/09/highly-sensitive-person-behaviors_n_7543140.html" target="_blank">Sensitive people get torn between speaking up for what they feel is right or sitting back because they don't want a violent type of reaction [from others]</a>," Aron previously told HuffPost Healthy Living.</p>
    <p>HSPs respond more productively to positive experiences rather than negative ones, Aron said. That means we're more likely to reach a solution through a more supportive interaction than an aggressive one.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>We need our emotions to be validated.</b><br>Phrases like "you take things too personally" can feel like a significant dig. For us, there's no such thing as feeling too much -- and it hurts when our emotions are viewed as a weakness. HSPs also tend to withdraw when they're being judged for their sensitivity, Aron said.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>We get bored easily.</b><br>According to Aron's research, sensitive folks get a little <a href="http://www.hsperson.com/pages/1Aug10.htm" target="_blank">restless in relationships that lack meaningful interactions</a> -- but that doesn't mean we'll throw in the towel. If anything, it's only going to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/09/highly-sensitive-person-behaviors_n_7543140.html" target="_blank">motivate HSPs to create more stimulating conversations</a>, she said.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>We're more emotionally reactive in our interactions.</b><br>PSA: We're probably going to cry. A lot. A partner who is understanding of a HSP's tendency to show their emotions is ideal for a successful relationship, Aron pointed out. "<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/09/highly-sensitive-person-behaviors_n_7543140.html" target="_blank">Sensitive people can't help but express what they're feeling</a>," Aron said. "They show their anger, they show their happiness. Appreciating that is really important."</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Our ideal date involves a little downtime.</b><br>We love dinner parties and exploring museums just as much as the next person, but don't forget to factor in a little "off" time. "They usually prefer to avoid overstimulation," Aron said. The bottom line? We prefer your company, the activity is secondary.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>We pay close attention to what our partner wants.</b><br>In Aron's research, she's also noticed that HSPs may have characteristic called "mate sensitivity," or the <a href="http://www.hsperson.com/pages/2May09.htm" target="_blank">ability to quickly assess what pleases their partner</a> and act based on that knowledge. This behavior also goes for platonic relationships as well.</p>
    <p>"They not just in tune to what's good for them but also what's good for others," Aron said. In other words, it makes us happy to make our significant other happy.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>We don't expect our partner to wear their heart on their sleeve.</b><br>Approximately <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/roya-r-rad-ma-psyd/highly-sensitive-people_b_1286508.html" target="_blank">20 percent of people are HSPs</a>, according to Aron's research. That means a significant majority doesn't identify with the personality trait -- and that's perfectly OK with us. Just because someone is highly sensitive doesn't mean they can't be in a relationship with someone who isn't (in fact, Aron says she identifies as a HSP while her husband does not).</p>
    <p>Ultimately, what matters to us is how we <i>feel</i> when we're with our significant other. Like all romantic partnerships, our relationships take patience, understanding and work. We just may have a few extra tears thrown into the mix -- and there's nothing wrong with that.</p>

    <h4><b>你的爱人是个神经质？那么你需要知道以下几点</b></h4>
    <br>
    <h5><b>文／林赛·福尔摩斯</b></h5>
    <br>
    <p>让我们实话实说吧：无论你拥有的是何种性格，恋爱交往总是一件复杂的事情。而有些真理不管到了哪里都会通行，比方说争吵不能带来乐趣，示爱总会得到感激，沟通尤其受人珍视，妥协不是那么容易。</p>
    <p>但是只有对于神经质的人来说，许多恋爱中的细微之处才会被小题大做。如果你的爱人是个神经质的话，那么关于他们的以下九点你需要铭记在心。</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>他们是直觉动物</b><br>在与人共处一室或是相互交谈时，神经质人群往往会<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/30/understanding-highly-sensitive-people_n_7164286.html" target="_blank">对些细枝末节的事情过度警觉</a>。这点虽然已不是什么新鲜事了，但还是值得在这里再三强调。对于神经质的人来说，如果他们的另一半不开心了，那么他们一定是能很快察觉到的。无论是一句调侃的话语或只是发短信的语气不同，都会让神经质的人心生波澜。“今晚我能见你吗？”和“今晚我们是不是约了见面？”这两句话是<b>完全</b>不同的。“我很好！”和“我很好。”也是同样的道理。</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>他们都爱得深沉</b><br>伊莲·雅朗是《高度敏感性人格》一书的作者，同样也是最早对神经质人群开展科学研究的学者之一。她认为，正因为神经质人群在生活中是如此地“意气用事”，他们往往会把一段感情看得很重。“无论是好奇心、爱心、愤怒或是恐惧，如果我们不是被情感所驱使，我们的脑中便会空无一物。“她告诉《赫芬顿邮报》。“我们有所思是因为我们有所牵挂。”</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>他们在与矛盾抗争</b><br>对于任何人来说，同自己的爱人争吵都是一种糟糕的体验。但对于神经质的人来说，冲突更加是一种折磨。那是因为在与人发生矛盾时，神经质人群的内心总是会反复纠结。“<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/09/highly-sensitive-person-behaviors_n_7543140.html" target="_blank">因为不想被人以暴力相待，神经质人群往往会在选择袒露心声还是将想法藏着掖着的时候倍受煎熬。</a>”雅朗不久前对《赫芬顿邮报》的健康生活板块说道。</p>
    <p>雅朗同时说，比起那些负面的经历，神经质人群更乐于对积极的事件展开回应。这就意味着通过选择一种更为鼓励而非高压的沟通方式，人们更可能与过于敏感的爱人找到解决矛盾的途径。</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>他们需要为自己感性的一面正名</b><br>“你总是感情用事”这样的话有时候会很伤人。对于神经质的人来说，关爱别人永远都不是一件有多过分的事情。而当神经质人群感性的一面被当成是弱点的时候，这往往对他们是一种打击。雅朗说，神经质的人群也在别人对自己敏感的性格说三道四的时候会有所保留。</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>他们都易于厌倦</b><br>根据雅朗的研究来看，<a href="http://www.hsperson.com/pages/1Aug10.htm" target="_blank">在一些索然无味的感情当中，神经质的人有时候会表现得焦躁不安</a>，但这并不意味着他们就会对感情缴械投降。雅朗说，如果说这会带来什么结果的话，它只会<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/09/highly-sensitive-person-behaviors_n_7543140.html" target="_blank">鼓励那些具有神经质人格的爱人展开一些更能激起另一半兴趣的话题</a>。</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>他们在人际交往当中更加多愁善感</b><br>神经质的恋人爱哭，而且总是哭哭啼啼。雅朗指出，能够理解神经质爱人这种乐于袒露情感的特点对于一段成功的感情来说大有裨益。“<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/09/highly-sensitive-person-behaviors_n_7543140.html" target="_blank">神经质的人群会毫不掩饰自己的喜怒哀乐</a>。”雅朗说。“他们展示自己的愤怒，同时也会传达自己的喜悦。懂得欣赏这一点是很重要的。”</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>他们心中理想的感情生活需要一些缓冲时间</b><br>神经质的人也会喜欢与亲友共进晚餐或是逛博物馆，这一点他们与常人无异。但同时也别忘了让他们拥有安宁的片刻。“神经质人群通常不喜欢接受过度刺激。”雅朗说道。他们心里的底线其实是：珍惜爱人的陪伴，至于在一起具体做什么倒是次要的。</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>他们对爱人的需求观察入微</b><br>雅朗在她的研究过程中同时也注意到，神经质的人群可能具有一种“察言观色”的性格特点。这是一种<a href="http://www.hsperson.com/pages/2May09.htm" target="_blank">审时度势地取悦自己伴侣的本领</a>。在那些纯精神的柏拉图式恋爱当中，我们同样能见到这种行为。</p>
    <p>“他们不但利己，也会利人。”雅朗说。换句话说，在让另一半开心的时候，神经质的人群自己也会感到开心。</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>他们并不刻意要求爱人也向他们敞开心扉</b><br>根据雅朗的研究，人群中<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/roya-r-rad-ma-psyd/highly-sensitive-people_b_1286508.html" target="_blank">大约只有 20% 的人属于神经质人格</a>。这意味着绝大多数的人不会对这种性格特质感同身受，但神经质人群不会在乎这些事情。一个人属于神经质人格并不意味着他／她就不能同非神经质人格的人谈恋爱。（事实上，雅朗说她自己就具有神经质人格，而她的丈夫并没有。）</p>
    <p>归根到底来说，在一段感情当中，恋爱双方相互之间的<b>感觉</b>才是最重要的。就如同任何一段浪漫的感情一样，与神经质爱人的交往总是需要报以耐心、理解和努力。神经质的爱人可能只是在这个过程当中多了一些喜怒哀乐而已，而这一点本来就无可厚非。</p>
